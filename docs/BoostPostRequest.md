## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**postId** | **String** | Zernio post ID (provide this or platformPostId) |  [optional] |
|**platformPostId** | **String** | Platform post ID (alternative to postId) |  [optional] |
|**accountId** | **String** | Social account ID |  |
|**adAccountId** | **String** | Platform ad account ID |  |
|**name** | **String** |  |  |
|**goal** | [**GoalEnum**](#GoalEnum) | Available goals vary by platform. Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and TikTok support all 7. LinkedIn supports all except app_promotion. Twitter/X supports engagement, traffic, awareness, video_views, app_promotion. Pinterest and Google Ads support only engagement, traffic, awareness, video_views. |  |
|**adSetId** | **String** | Meta only. Attach the boosted post to this existing ad set instead of creating a campaign. The ad set then owns budget, schedule and targeting; sending those too is a 400. |  [optional] |
|**budget** | [**BoostPostRequestBudget**](BoostPostRequestBudget.md) |  |  [optional] |
|**instagramAccountId** | **String** | Meta only. Instagram identity the ad runs AS (creative.instagram_user_id), overriding the account linked to the Page. Live-verified against a Page-post creative. |  [optional] |
|**destinationType** | [**DestinationTypeEnum**](#DestinationTypeEnum) | Meta only. Ad-set destination_type — where the click LANDS, as opposed to instagramAccountId which is who the ad runs as. Lead ads force ON_AD and ignore this. |  [optional] |
|**currency** | **String** | ISO 4217 currency code matching the ad account&#39;s currency. Meta only. Optional: Zernio resolves it from the ad account when omitted. The value selects the minor-unit exponent Zernio converts budget/bid amounts by before calling Meta (most currencies are cents; zero-decimal currencies like JPY/KRW are sent as-is). |  [optional] |
|**schedule** | [**BoostPostRequestSchedule**](BoostPostRequestSchedule.md) |  |  [optional] |
|**targeting** | [**BoostPostRequestTargeting**](BoostPostRequestTargeting.md) |  |  [optional] |
|**rawTargeting** | **Map&lt;String, Object&gt;** | Meta only. A Meta-native targeting spec (e.g. &#x60;{ \&quot;geo_locations\&quot;: { \&quot;cities\&quot;: [{ \&quot;key\&quot;: \&quot;...\&quot;, \&quot;radius\&quot;: 15, \&quot;distance_unit\&quot;: \&quot;kilometer\&quot; }] } }&#x60;). Sent alone it is forwarded unchanged. Use for advanced fields the structured object does not expose (flexible_spec, excluded audiences, business places, user_os, wireless_carrier).  Can be combined with &#x60;targeting&#x60;: rawTargeting is the BASE layer and the built camelCase spec is merged on top, key by key (camelCase wins on collision). The merge goes one level deep inside &#x60;geo_locations&#x60; and &#x60;excluded_geo_locations&#x60; (built sub-keys win; raw-only sub-keys such as &#x60;location_types&#x60; survive). Array values (&#x60;flexible_spec&#x60;, ...) are replaced as a whole key, never element-merged.  When &#x60;rawTargeting&#x60; is present the &#x60;advantage_audience: 0&#x60; default that Zernio normally applies is no longer emitted, so it cannot clobber a &#x60;targeting_automation&#x60; sent in the raw spec. Meta requires &#x60;targeting_automation&#x60; on ad set creation, so include it in the raw spec, or send &#x60;targeting.advantage_audience&#x60; (0 or 1), which is merged over raw as &#x60;targeting_automation&#x60;.  |  [optional] |
|**bidStrategy** | **BidStrategy** | Deprecated: send it inside &#x60;platformSpecificData&#x60; instead (Meta today; TikTok&#39;s nested shape is planned). The flat field keeps working during the deprecation window; sending both shapes returns a 400.  Meta bid strategy applied to the ad set. On TikTok, mapped to &#x60;bid_type&#x60; / &#x60;bid_price&#x60; / &#x60;deep_bid_type&#x60; automatically.  |  [optional] |
|**bidAmount** | **BigDecimal** | Deprecated: send it inside &#x60;platformSpecificData&#x60; instead (Meta today; TikTok&#39;s nested shape is planned). The flat field keeps working during the deprecation window; sending both shapes returns a 400.  Bid cap in WHOLE currency units (USD: 5 &#x3D; $5.00; JPY: 100 &#x3D; ¥100). Required when &#x60;bidStrategy&#x60; is &#x60;LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP&#x60; or &#x60;COST_CAP&#x60;. Backward-compat: providing &#x60;bidAmount&#x60; without &#x60;bidStrategy&#x60; is treated as &#x60;LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP&#x60;.  |  [optional] |
|**roasAverageFloor** | **BigDecimal** | Deprecated: send it inside &#x60;platformSpecificData&#x60; instead (Meta today; TikTok&#39;s nested shape is planned). The flat field keeps working during the deprecation window; sending both shapes returns a 400.  Minimum ROAS as a decimal multiplier (e.g. 2.0 &#x3D; 2.0x ROAS). Required when &#x60;bidStrategy&#x60; is &#x60;LOWEST_COST_WITH_MIN_ROAS&#x60;. Sent to Meta as &#x60;bid_constraints.roas_average_floor&#x60; × 10000 (Meta uses fixed-point integers).  |  [optional] |
|**platformSpecificData** | [**BoostPostRequestPlatformSpecificData**](BoostPostRequestPlatformSpecificData.md) |  |  [optional] |
|**tracking** | [**BoostPostRequestTracking**](BoostPostRequestTracking.md) |  |  [optional] |
|**specialAdCategories** | [**List&lt;SpecialAdCategoriesEnum&gt;**](#List&lt;SpecialAdCategoriesEnum&gt;) | Meta only. Required for housing, employment, credit, or political ads. |  [optional] |
|**specialAdCategoryCountry** | **List&lt;String&gt;** | Meta (metaads) only. 2-letter ISO country codes the special ad category applies to. Requires specialAdCategories to be set (400 otherwise). |  [optional] |
|**linkUrl** | **URI** | Destination URL for the CTA button. Send it together with &#x60;callToAction&#x60;.  **Meta**: adds a top-level &#x60;call_to_action&#x60; to the post-reference creative. This is what gives a &#x60;traffic&#x60; boost a clickable destination without replacing the creative and losing the post&#39;s social proof. Ignored when &#x60;leadGenFormId&#x60; is set, which supplies its own destination. Live-verified against a Page-post creative.  **TikTok**: maps to &#x60;landing_page_url&#x60; on the Spark Ad creative (&#x60;AdcreateCreatives.landing_page_url&#x60;); Spark Ads have no clickable destination without it.  Ignored on LinkedIn / Pinterest / X / Google, which infer the destination from the boosted post.  |  [optional] |
|**callToAction** | **String** | CTA button label. Send it together with &#x60;linkUrl&#x60; — a CTA without a destination produces a button that goes nowhere, so sending one alone is a 400.  **Meta**: the CTA enum of POST /v1/ads/create plus &#x60;VIEW_INSTAGRAM_PROFILE&#x60;, which is accepted on boost only. For that value &#x60;linkUrl&#x60; is typically the Instagram profile URL.  **TikTok**: pass-through to &#x60;call_to_action&#x60; on the Spark Ad creative; the platform validates the value. See TikTok&#39;s \&quot;Enumeration - Call-to-Action\&quot;.  |  [optional] |
|**sparkAuthCode** | **String** | TikTok-only. Spark Code (creator&#39;s &#x60;auth_code&#x60;) authorizing cross-creator Spark Ads — the advertiser can boost a video owned by a DIFFERENT TikTok account. Without this, boosts are limited to videos owned by the same account running the ads (same-BC creators only). The creator generates the code in their TikTok app&#39;s Promote settings and shares it with the advertiser. Maps to &#x60;auth_code&#x60; on the creative entry of /v2/ad/create/.  |  [optional] |
|**dsaBeneficiary** | **String** | Legal entity that benefits from the ad. Required when targeting EU users (EU DSA, Article 26). Optional if the ad account has a default beneficiary: set it once via &#x60;PATCH /v1/ads/accounts&#x60; or in Meta Ads Manager, and Meta fills it in whenever the field is omitted.  |  [optional] |
|**dsaPayor** | **String** | Legal entity that pays for the ad. Can differ from &#x60;dsaBeneficiary&#x60; (for example, an agency paying for a client&#39;s ads). Same rules as &#x60;dsaBeneficiary&#x60;: required for EU targeting unless the ad account has a default payor.  |  [optional] |
|**optimizationGoal** | **String** | Meta only. Explicit ad-set &#x60;optimization_goal&#x60; override. When omitted, defaults to the value derived from &#x60;goal&#x60;. The value must be compatible with the objective Meta derives from &#x60;goal&#x60;, not with the objective used by &#x60;POST /v1/ads/create&#x60; for the same &#x60;goal&#x60; name: boost maps &#x60;goal: \&quot;engagement\&quot;&#x60; to objective &#x60;OUTCOME_AWARENESS&#x60;, which accepts &#x60;REACH&#x60;, &#x60;IMPRESSIONS&#x60;, &#x60;AD_RECALL_LIFT&#x60;, or THRUPLAY-class values, and rejects &#x60;POST_ENGAGEMENT&#x60; (that value is only valid under &#x60;OUTCOME_ENGAGEMENT&#x60;, which create uses for the same goal name).  |  [optional] |
