## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**name** | **String** | Webhook name (1-50 characters) |  |
|**url** | **URI** | Webhook endpoint URL (must be a valid URL, whitespace trimmed) |  |
|**secret** | **String** | Secret key for HMAC-SHA256 signature verification |  [optional] |
|**events** | [**List&lt;EventsEnum&gt;**](#List&lt;EventsEnum&gt;) | Events to subscribe to (at least one required) |  |
|**isActive** | **Boolean** | Enable or disable webhook delivery. Defaults to &#x60;true&#x60; when omitted. |  [optional] |
|**customHeaders** | **Map&lt;String, String&gt;** | Custom headers to include in webhook requests |  [optional] |
|**disabledResourceGroups** | [**List&lt;DisabledResourceGroupsEnum&gt;**](#List&lt;DisabledResourceGroupsEnum&gt;) | Resource groups this subscription does not receive (opt-out denylist). Omit or send an empty array to receive every event in &#x60;events&#x60;. Listing a group here drops its events before delivery and on every replay path. Set at creation it applies to everything this subscription ever receives; changed later via PUT it applies to events emitted after the change, with a five-minute tail for events already queued (see that operation). When the caller is a restricted (zrk_) key, that key&#39;s own disabled groups are unioned into whatever you send here, so a restricted key can never create a subscription wider than itself. |  [optional] |
