# WebhookPayloadMessageEdited

Webhook payload for message.edited events. Fires when the sender edits a previously-sent message. Supported platforms: Instagram, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, WhatsApp. The message object reflects the LATEST state; editHistory contains every prior version in order (oldest first), so the last entry is the version immediately before the current content. 

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**test** | **Boolean** | Always true when present: only a sample sent by POST /v1/webhooks/test with an event carries it. Real deliveries never do. |  [optional] |
|**id** | **String** | Stable webhook event ID: the dedupe key, also sent as the X-Zernio-Event-Id header and identical on every retry and redelivery. It identifies the event only, never an account or other resource. |  |
|**profiles** | [**List&lt;WebhookProfilesInner&gt;**](WebhookProfilesInner.md) | The profiles this event belongs to, each with the externalId you set on it (null when none is set). Use it to route the event to your tenant without storing Zernio profile ids.  Present on every event tied to a profile, absent on events that belong to none. Events spanning several profiles (a post published to accounts of different profiles) list each once.  |  [optional] |
|**event** | [**EventEnum**](#EventEnum) |  |  |
|**message** | [**InboxWebhookMessage**](InboxWebhookMessage.md) |  |  |
|**editHistory** | [**List&lt;InboxMessageEditHistoryEntry&gt;**](InboxMessageEditHistoryEntry.md) | Prior versions of the message, oldest first. |  |
|**editCount** | **Integer** | Total number of edits applied to this message. |  |
|**editedAt** | **OffsetDateTime** | When the most recent edit happened. |  |
|**conversation** | [**InboxWebhookConversation**](InboxWebhookConversation.md) |  |  |
|**account** | [**InboxWebhookAccount**](InboxWebhookAccount.md) |  |  |
|**timestamp** | **OffsetDateTime** | UTC time at which Zernio generated this event (set once when the event payload is built, before delivery is queued). Retries and redeliveries keep the original value, so it reflects the event, not the delivery attempt. |  |
