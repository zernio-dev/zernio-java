# GetGoogleBusinessLocationDetails200ResponseLocation

Compact public-facing summary derived from Google's `metadata`. Useful for surfacing the \"leave a review\" URL (e.g. behind a QR code) without parsing the raw block. Always populated regardless of readMask. For unverified or new locations Google omits placeId/reviewUrl/mapsUri, so those return as null and `isVerified` is false.
